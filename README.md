# Semi Supervised Text Classification with Active Learning
Term Project for class CMPE - 547, Bayesian Statistics and Machine Learning

Special thanks to [Jesper Wohlert](https://github.com/wohlert) for the [repo](https://github.com/wohlert/semi-supervised-pytorch).

His project is extended with new VAE architecture, ProdLDA, for details [see](https://github.com/atakanguney/semi-supervised-text-classification/blob/master/semi-supervised-pytorch/semi-supervised/models/prodlda.py).

For Deep Generative Model, [see](https://github.com/atakanguney/semi-supervised-text-classification/blob/master/semi-supervised-pytorch/semi-supervised/models/prodldadgm.py).
